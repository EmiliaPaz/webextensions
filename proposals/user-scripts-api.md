# User Scripts API

## Background

### User Scripts and User Scripts Managers

[User scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) are (usually relatively small) snippets of code that are injected into web pages in order to modify the page's appearance or behavior.  User script managers are a type of extension that is used to manage the collection of these user scripts, determining when and how to inject them on web pages.

User scripts can be created directly by the user or found in a number of different user script repositories around the web.

### Manifest V3

Manifest Version 3 (MV3) restricts the ability for extensions to use remotely-hosted code since it is a major security risk (cannot review or audit code that isn't in the extension package).  This is directly at odds with user script managers, which fundamentally require the execution of arbitrary code (the user scripts themselves).  This creates a feature gap between MV2 and MV3.

## Goal

User scripts satisfy an important use case for power users, allowing them to quickly and easily tweak the functionality of a web page.  Therefore, we propose adding a **new API to register user scripts with arbitrary code** targeted specifically for user scripts.  However, we will also take a number of steps to help reduce the abuse-ability of this API and ensure we don't lose the benefits of the remotely-hosted code restrictions from MV3.

### Multi-phase design

User script support will have a multiphase design and implementation process. The initial implementation has the following goals:

- Achieving functional parity with MV2 for user scripts managers
- Setting the foundations needed for future enhancements
- Limiting abusability

### Initial Requirements

The rest of this proposal focuses on the first iteration with the following requirements:

- **(A)** A mechanism to execute code in the main world 
- **(B)** The ability to execute code (with a separate CSP) in a world different from the main world and the extension's isolated world
- **(C)** A separate user script permission
- **(D)** Communication between JavaScript worlds

## Proposal

### New Namespace

User scripting related features will be exposed in a new API namespace, tentatively named "userScripts". The proposal authors favor the use of a new namespace for several reasons.

1. **Better set developer expectations.**  The clear separation between user and content scripts will reduce confusion for developers for which API methods to use and what the capabilities / restrictions of each are.  This naming also more clearly communicates that this capability is not meant as a general purpose way to inject arbitrary scripts.

2. **Stronger enforcement of remotely hosted code abuse.**  A distinct namespace allows people to more clearly see where user scripts features are being used and more easily spot abuse patterns.

3. **Easier engineering implementation.**  Browser vendors should be able to restrict the execution world and different API methods behind features.

4. **Introduce a user script world with custom CSP.**  Allow user scripts to opt-in to a more secure world that is only available in this namespace.

### API Schema

#### Types

```
dictionary RegisteredUserScript {
  boolean? allFrames;
  string code;
  string[]? excludeMatches;
  string id;
  string[]? matches;
  RunAt runAt;
  // Allows `USER_SCRIPT` (default) and `MAIN`
  // and returns error for `ISOLATED`.
  ExecutionWorld? world; 
  string[]? includeGlobs;
  string[]? excludeGlobs;
}
dictionary UserScriptFilter {
  string[]? ids;
}
```

#### Methods

```
browser.userScripts.register(
  scripts: RegisteredUserScript[],
  callback?: function
)
browser.userScripts.unregister(
  filter?: UserScriptFilter[],
  callback?: function
)
browser.userScripts.getScripts(
  filter?: UserScriptFilter[],
  callback?: function
)
browser.userScripts.update(
  scripts?: RegisteredUserScript[],
  callback?: function
)
```

### Requirements

#### A. A mechanism to execute code in the main world

- User scripts can be registered in the `MAIN` world.
- Extension can customize the `USER_SCRIPT` world CSP to inject a script tag into the host page (expanded in requirement B)

#### B. The ability to execute code (with a separate CSP) in a world different from the main world and the extension's isolated world

##### `USER_SCRIPT` World

- Isolated from the web page (similar to other isolated worlds), but will be un-permissioned.  It will not have access to any extension APIs or cross-origin exceptions (these don't exist in Chrome, but do in other browsers).
- Exempt from the page's CSP (see Relax CSP).
- Share DOM with the web page.  Code from both worlds cannot directly interact with each other, except through DOM APIs.
- Can communicate with different JS worlds via [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).  A dedicated API to communicate between worlds is being considered as part of future work.
When an asymmetric security relationship may exist, the `MAIN` world is considered to be less privileged than the `USER_SCRIPT` world

##### Relax CSP

```
browser.userScripts.configureWorld(
  csp: string
)
```
- Extension can customize the `USER_SCRIPT` world CSP. This will only affect scripts registered for the `USER_SCRIPT` world.  Scripts registered for the `MAIN` world will abide by the main world CSP.
- By default, the `USER_SCRIPT` world CSP is undefined.
- When `USER_SCRIPT` is undefined, the user agent will fall back to the extensionâ€™s `ISOLATED` world CSP

#### C. A separate user script permission

- A new extension permission will be added, and will be required in order to register user scripts.  This permission should be scoped specifically to the purpose of user scripts (as opposed to a general "remotely-hosted code" permission).
- Browser vendors then can use it to:
  - Inform their review pipeline that this is a particularly risky extension, and extra caution should be taken to ensure this is a valid use of the API.
  - Reduce the likelihood of extensions using it for other purposes and allows browser vendors to act on any permissions that do as being non-compliant
  - Present the user with different permission warnings, UI, or other gating, if they deem it necessary.

#### D. Communication between JavaScript worlds

As mentioned in requirement A, the user script world can communicate with different JS worlds via [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) and DOM APIs. New communication methods are being considered as potential future enhancements.

###  Other considerations

- When multiple scripts match and have the same runAt schedule, the execution order is:
  - Scripts registered via the content_scripts key in the manifest file
  - Scripts registered via [`scripting.registerContentScripts()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/scripting/#method-registerContentScripts)
  - Scripts registered via `userScripts.register()`
- This ordering allows the extension to prepare the execution environment before the user script code is executed.
- User scripts are always persisted across sessions, since the opposite behavior would be uncommon

### Browser level restrictions

From here, each browser vendor should be able to implement their own restrictions. Chrome is exploring limiting the access to this API when the user has enabled developer mode (bug), but permission grants are outside of the scope of this API proposal. 

## (Potential) Future Enhancements

### `USER_SCRIPT` World Communication

In the future, we may want to provide a more straightforward path for communication with a `USER_SCRIPT` world (as opposed to the [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) approach highlighted above).

### Separate `USER_SCRIPT` Worlds

In addition to specifying the execution world of `USER_SCRIPT`, we could allow extensions to provide an identifier for the world.  Scripts injected with the same identifier would inject in the same world, while scripts with different world identifiers inject in different worlds.  This would allow for greater isolation between user scripts (if, for instance, the user had multiple unrelated user scripts injecting on the same page).

### Execute user scripts one time

Currently, user scripts are registered and executed every time it matches the origin in a persistent way. We may explore a way to execute a user script only one time to provide a new capability to user scripts (e.g `browser.userScripts.execute()`).

## Discussion Guidelines

Please keep discussion to the first iteration introduced by this proposal. Future enhancements can be tracked in the WECG [issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/issues).
